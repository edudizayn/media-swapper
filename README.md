# Media Swapper

A simple Bash script to swap MKV to MP4 and M4A to MP3.

## Requirements

You'll need to have either Docker, FFMpeg or AVConv installed on your machine for this script to work.

## Usage

You can convert all the media in the current directory by just running the script: `./swap_media`

Or you can specify a specific directory: `./swap_media /path/to/videos`
